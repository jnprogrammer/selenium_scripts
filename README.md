# selenium_v1
You will need webdrivers for Chrome and firefox to run these.
I assume you are on a Unix based os
If you have the set up for selenium drivers already just run the bash script and pick
a file, it will download that file for you into the directory of the script. Have fun.
I wrote this in vi like it was intended thousands of years ago when the gods of olympus 
forged Unix to be divided amoung us mortals.
